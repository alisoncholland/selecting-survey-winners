This script contains code to select survey winners from a selection of users. 
Data is from a quantitative survey.

Installation 
I used the free statistical software programme R (https://www.r-project.org/) to write and analyse my data. 
Once R is up and running, install and load the CRAN packages listed in the code. 
Usage Feel free to use whatever code you like. All I kindly ask in return is that you cite it appropriately :)
